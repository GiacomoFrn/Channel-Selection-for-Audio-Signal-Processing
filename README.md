# Channel-Selection-for-Audio-Signal-Processing
In the following project we report used a FIR filter,
implemented through an FPGA, to perform a channel selection operation. We
worked with stereo audio signals using the Digilent Pmod I2S2 interface board.
The correct implementation of the filter on the FPGA has been verified through
comparison with a Python simulation, in which we also showed a simple use of
this channel separation filter: the selection of the desired channel in an AM
radio receiver.
